@tik Google Rich Snippets

Purpose
=======

Rich Snippets are a way to provide Google detailed product information in a structured way so that in search results it can display rich snippets (for example, price, availability, and review ratings)

Sample: http://www.google.com/help/hc/images/webmasters_1095551_en.png

Rich snippets help you to:

- Attract potential buyers while they are searching for items to buy on Google.
- Submit your product listings for free.
- Control your product information. You can maintain the accuracy and freshness of your product information, so your customers find the relevant, current items they're looking for.

Because this is a vQmod, no core files are touched, and the changes should carry over to the next version.
